    "title":"Who are Bahujanas?",
    "whyBhaujan":"Gauthama Buddha expounded that the Bahujan, i.e., the majority of the people in a society must be happy. Respectable Kanshiram said that most of the people, that is almost eighty five percent.Those over whom there is high handedness of feudal lords; those who have been pushed away from exercising power by the very few families of the ruling class;those who are being treated as slaves in each and every village across the country even today, in the name of caste and religion; those who are being labelled as minorities and shown open disgust,an action that is significantly against the spirit of the Constitution; these are the Bahujans people. Their sorrows are the nation's sorrow; their progress is the nation's progress; their contributions are the nation's pride. The Bahujan people comprise almost 85% of the population and include all marginalised sections of society, such as ST, SC, BC, other sub-castes and religious minorities. In unification, they are capable of single handedly ruling the nation.They have been foundational to the evolution of the Indian nation."
