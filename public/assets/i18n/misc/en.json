  "whyRsp1": "RSP deeply believes that constitutional morality and rights based public policies are very important to ensure that everyone in this country leads a self-reliant and dignified life.",
  "whyRsp2": "His actions embed a deep sense of constitutional morality as professed by Dr BR Ambedkar and pragmatic realism of Kanshiram. An illustration of this can be evident from his work as the Secretary for Telangana Welfare Institutions where he successfully experimented with ‘quality education as an instrument for making younger generations achieve socio-economic liberty in the face of all forms of exclusion.  ",
  "whyRsp3": "For the first time in the State of Telangana, RSP led an establishment of Welfare Degree Colleges for Women and Men from the marginalized communities.  His vision follows a principle of “don't give the fish, teach how to fish”.  This implies to enable self-reliance, progressive, and resilience among the downtrodden and other religious minority sections in Telangana. To achieve these objectives, five key sectors would be focused during the Bahujan Rule in the State:",
  "whyRsphead": "Five sectors for development:",
  "p1": "Quality Education and Socio-economic Empowerment",
  "p2": "Health and Well-being of All",
  "p3": "Development of the Youth, Skills and Women Entrepreneurship",
  "p4": "Political empowerment through proportional representation and accountable self-governance across all levels.",
  "p5": "Affordable Housing and Sustainable Infrastructure ",
  "title": "Who are Bahujanas?",
  "whyBhaujan": "Gauthama Buddha expounded that the Bahujan, i.e., the majority of the people in a society must be happy. Respectable Kanshiram said that most of the people, that is almost eighty five percent.Those over whom there is high handedness of feudal lords; those who have been pushed away from exercising power by the very few families of the ruling class;those who are being treated as slaves in each and every village across the country even today, in the name of caste and religion; those who are being labelled as minorities and shown open disgust,an action that is significantly against the spirit of the Constitution; these are the Bahujans people. Their sorrows are the nation's sorrow; their progress is the nation's progress; their contributions are the nation's pride. The Bahujan people comprise almost 85% of the population and include all marginalised sections of society, such as ST, SC, BC, other sub-castes and religious minorities. In unification, they are capable of single handedly ruling the nation.They have been foundational to the evolution of the Indian nation."
